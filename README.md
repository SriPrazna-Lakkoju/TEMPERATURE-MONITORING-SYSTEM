DESCRIPTION : 
WHAT IS IT?

A Temperature Monitoring System is a project that measures the temperature around a sensor and shows it on a display or Serial Monitor. It helps you track temperature in real time, which is useful in homes, labs, greenhouses, fridges, etc.

HOW DOES IT WORK?
A temperature sensor (like LM35 or DHT11) reads the surrounding temperature.
The sensor sends the data to a microcontroller (like Arduino).
The Arduino processes the data.
The result is displayed on:
An LCD screen, or
The Serial Monitor on a computer, or
A mobile app (if Bluetooth is added)

COMPONENETS:
Component	Purpose
Arduino UNO/Nano	The brain of the system
Temperature sensor (e.g., LM35, DHT11, or DS18B20)	To measure temperature
LCD (16x2) or Serial Monitor	To show the temperature
Breadboard + Jumper wires	For easy connections
(Optional) Buzzer/LED	For temperature warning alerts
